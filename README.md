# Monte Carlo Pi Calculator Simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation I created that calculates the value of pi by creating a virtual dart board and calculates the ratio of "darts" inside a circle of a given radius and total number of darts. Multiplying this number by 4 gets closer and closer to the value of pi as more darts are
placed on the board.
